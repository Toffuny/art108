    <h3>Blog Post #5</h3>
      <p>
        My partner and I's game, which has not yet been named, was tried by others for the first time this past Friday in class. The process leading up to this playtesting session was one of
        just figuring out how to make stuff work on our own. My partner was the artist while I was the programmer. The game that we planned out was that a girl would be trying to collect candy while
        avoiding the Halloween demons that pop up and try to take her soul away. The map would The original goal of the playable was to have the character assets in the game
        and create the basic mechanics of it. As the programmer, I set about trying to create the swinging attack motion for the character as well as spawning enemies that target the character.
        Through the wonder of YouTube tutorials, I was able to get accomplish most of what we planned for me to do, however I ended up just doing a shooting animation instead of a swinging one
        due to the fact that my brain couldn't fathom how I would see a swinging animation with just a circle (I was only using basic shapes at this time as I haven't been given the character assets yet).
        <br>
        During the playtest though, our playtesters loved the shooting! They found it to be fun and challenging; it even got to the point where, when we asked if we should continue with the shooting aspect or
        go with the original plan of swinging, they were all for the shooting! Both of the feedback sheets also had similar opinions of what colors, theme, and attack element should be in our game. Therefore, based
        on the feedback, we decided to keep the shooting as well as convert the game from having the objective be collecting candy to the player trying to navigate the player out of a maze without
        getting killed by the demons. Thus our new plan is now unfolding.
